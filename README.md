# handy_headers
This is a collection of C Header files that i use regularly in my projects. Some of these are usefull in spesific cases and some of them can be used more generaly.

## Header File Descriptions

- **[hh_argparse.h](include/hh_argparse.h)**  
  A header-only command line argument parser. It provides functions to initialize and deinitialize a parser, retrieve short and long options, check for the presence of options, and access positional arguments. Designed for simple and efficient command-line parsing in C projects.

- **[hh_bigint.h](include/hh_bigint.h)**  
  A header-only big integer library for dynamically sized integers. It supports initialization, deinitialization, resizing, arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply), bitwise operations, shifting, and conversion from/to strings and buffers. Useful for handling integers larger than standard C types.

- **[hh_darray.h](include/hh_darray.h)**  
  A header-only dynamic array library for general-purpose use. It allows initialization, deinitialization, appending, inserting, removing, and accessing elements of arbitrary type. The implementation supports automatic resizing and chaining for efficient
